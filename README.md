# 🎓 Student Grade Tracker

A Java-based GUI application for managing student grades, calculating statistics, and displaying a summary report. This project was built to practice core Java concepts and GUI programming using JavaFX (or Swing).

## 🚀 Features

- Input and manage student names and grades
- Calculate:
  - 📊 Average grade
  - 🏆 Highest and lowest grades (with student names)
  - ✅ Number of passing students
- Display a full summary report in a clear GUI
- Simple and intuitive interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- JavaFX *(or Swing — depending on your project)*
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
